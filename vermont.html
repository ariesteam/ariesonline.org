	    	  		<p class="MsoNormal">Preliminary models of carbon sequestration and storage were 
                      developed to assess the sequestration and storage potential of the mixed agricultural 
                      and forested landscapes in Vermont. Spatial data for soil, climate, and vegetation 
                      characteristics was coupled with prior information on land management techniques to 
                      quantify stocks and flows in terrestrial carbon pools. In addition to describing 
                      existing carbon sequestration and storage levels, this model could also be used to 
                      explore how different land management activities might affect carbon uptake. If through 
                      application of novel ecosystem service models, rural working landscapes can be shown 
                      to provide substantial carbon uptake potential, this provides motivation for the 
                      development of multifunctional agricultural landscapes. Such landscapes might 
                      simultaneously sequester carbon (and nutrients) while providing food and energy 
                      products for market, demonstrating the role that human managed landscapes play in 
                      supplying economic and ecological goods and services.<o:p></o:p></p>

                    <h5 class="style10">Practical application: Scenic viewsheds</h5>
	    	  		<p class="MsoNormal">This project focused on viewshed values associated with viewpoints 
                      located within a newly created Nature Conservancy Preserve in the Chittenden County, Vermont. 
                      This 366-acre preserve, Raven Ridge, is located in the towns of Monkton, Charlotte, and 
                      Hinesburg. Trails located on the property lead to bedrock outcroppings that afford views 
                      over the Champlain Valley and the Adirondacks as well as viewpoints located along Lewis 
                      Creek and looking west toward the Green Mountains. Understanding the relative view source 
                      values for each viewpoint can help The Nature Conservancy manage for recreation use related 
                      to views within Raven Ridge Preserve.  While originally established for an area with relatively 
                      small scope (the Raven Ridge Preserve), this model could be expanded and applied more broadly 
                      to the Northern Forest region of northeastern United States, particularly the Adirondacks, 
                      Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.<o:p></o:p></p>

				<h4>In northern New England, a century of forest regrowth following intensive 
                  agricultural clearance has led to a landscape dominated small- to medium-scale 
                  agriculture and second-growth forests.  These forests provide numerous recreational 
                  opportunities, provide employment in the forestry and forest products industries, 
                  sequester and store carbon, and provide various other ecosystem services.  Within 
                  the region's agricultural and forest communities, there is increasing interest in 
                  managing both forests and farmland to increase carbon sequestration and storage and 
                  absorb nutrients from waterways.  Developing payments for ecosystem services (PES) 
                  programs like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and other local policies 
                  could support these efforts, but would benefit from emerging ecosystem service models 
                  to quantify ecosystem services under different management alternatives.<br>

				Following past ecosystem services modeling approaches “causal webs” 
                of factors affecting carbon dynamics in agricultural and forest soils 
                and vegetation were developed. Factors for calculating carbon sequestration 
                provision were derived from a literature review and from available GIS data 
                for climatic conditions, soils, and vegetative cover. The results are a set 
                of preliminary carbon sequestration and storage models for agricultural and 
                forest landscapes in Vermont.<br><br>Past spatial ecosystem 
				service models of terrestrial (i.e. within vegetation and soils) 
				carbon sequestration have focused on forest biomass carbon 
				uptake. However, several researchers have noted the potential 
				for diverse, holistically managed agricultural landscapes to 
				sequester carbon in vegetative biomass as well as soils. Farms 
				of the northeastern United States are diverse landscapes 
				incorporating row crops, grasslands, wetlands and woodlots, 
				which might be managed for both soil and vegetative carbon 
				sequestration. This research seeks to quantify the role that 
				these diverse farm landscapes can play in terrestrial carbon 
				sequestration through the application of BNN models.<br><br>A similar process was 
                followed to map viewshed quality and use, based on sources of aesthetically valuable 
                views including mountains, water bodies, and a heterogeneous pattern of land cover 
                representing both forested and agricultural lands.  Recreational users of aesthetic 
                views are those people that access view points along trails or at scenic vistas. 
                Their enjoyment may depend on the relative elevation of the vista.  As a view travels 
                from source to user, it may be physically blocked by buildings, trees, or topography.  
                Its quality may be depleted by air pollution or visual blight, such as highways, forest 
                clearcuts, or visually unappealing land use types like commercial, industrial, or 
                transportation uses.  Such sources of visual blight can also be mapped using source, 
                sink, use and flow models for viewsheds.<br><br>
