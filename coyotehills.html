					West Coyote Hills can help stakeholders to elucidate how 
					much surrounding residents and businesses benefit from the 
					natural functions of the property, in relation to other 
					environmental assets in the watershed.&nbsp; Furthermore, 
					beneficiaries of the carbon sequestration and flood 
					regulation services can be located with precision and the 
					quantity of carbon sequestered and amount of flood 
					protection provided can be calculated and depicted 
					spatially.&nbsp; Moreover, the ARIES maps can help to inform 
					development siting, ecosystem service management, and 
					different planning scenarios can be tested to provide 
					analysis of alternative management approaches.&nbsp; 
					Developers may also choose to use ARIES as a communication 
					tool to present community-based decisions that are firmly 
					founded in science. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

				forces of rapid urban expansion are causing a rise in demand for 
				urban ecosystem services. This swell in demand is also driving 
				an increase in their perceived value.&nbsp; Therefore, 
				landowners, developers, planners, and cities are keenly 
				interested in how to best manage such environmental assets.&nbsp; 
				The West Coyote Hills property is prototypical of this 
				phenomenon, and establishes a proof-of-concept for the ARIES 
				approach using real world data at the project site scale (ca. 550 acres). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

				<p style="height: 22px;"><span>The West Coyote Hills case study 
				was completed in two phases.&nbsp; In the first phase a scope of work 
				was determined through discussion with the landowner and 
				research team.&nbsp; Then, ecosystem services and their beneficiaries 
				were identified, from which two services were selected for 
				modeling with ARIES.&nbsp; Next, biophysical, ecological, and 
				socioeconomic spatial datasets were collected and prepared for 
				use with the ARIES system. In phase 2 models were built for 
				carbon sequestration and storage and flood regulation, 
				accounting for regional characteristics of southern 
				Californian.&nbsp; Further calibration of the models was performed 
				based on preliminary sensitivity analyses and data was 
				integrated into the system for model runs.&nbsp; Then, source, sink, 
				use, and flow simulations were performed resulting in spatial 
				outputs. A total of 24 maps were produced, each providing unique 
				insights into how the ecosystem services were generated at West 
				Coyote Hills and delivered to the end users throughout the 
				watershed and beyond.&nbsp; We have not yet completed a third phase, consisting of post hoc 
				sensitivity analysis and optimization techniques, which would yield actionable model outputs 
                to fully support local decision making. </span></p>
