				<h3 class="style14">In Vermont, sources of aesthetically 
				valuable views include large mountains like the Green Mountains 
				or the Adirondacks, water bodies such as rivers or large lakes 
				like Lake Champlain, and a heterogeneous pattern of land cover 
				representing both forested and agricultural lands (Vissering, 
				pers. comm.).&nbsp; Recreational users of aesthetic views are 
				those people that access view points along trails or at scenic 
				vistas. Their enjoyment may depend on the relative elevation of 
				the vista (Zube et al. 1975).&nbsp; As a view travels from 
				source to user, it may be physically blocked by buildings, 
				trees, or topography.&nbsp; Its quality may be depleted by air 
				pollution or visual blight, such as highways, forest clearcuts, 
				or visually unappealing land use types like commercial, 
				industrial, or transportation uses.&nbsp; Such sources of visual 
				blight can also be mapped.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Aesthetic view source value.&nbsp;
				</span></b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mountains, open water, forested and 
				open lands are commonly valued objects in viewsheds (Manning et. 
				al. 2006, Chhetri and Arrowsmith 2003, USFS 1995, Zube et. al. 
				1975, USFS 1974).&nbsp; As prior probability distributions, I 
				estimated that 4% of the landscape is open water, any of lake, 
				pond, river or stream. In Vermont, only 1% of the landscape 
				falls above 3000’ (large mountains), 29 % between 1500 – 3000’ 
				(small mountains) and 70% below 1,500 feet (no mountain). <o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Open space is defined as undeveloped 
				lands, including agricultural, forested, and other types of land 
				cover. Agricultural lands include pasture land, crop land, and 
				orchards. Other open land includes barren lands, brush and 
				transitional lands, and wetlands. Forested lands include 
				broadleaf forests, coniferous forests, and mixed forests. Based 
				on the 2001 National Land Use/Land Cover database, prior 
				probability distributions for Vermont were established as 72.8% 
				forested, 10.4% agricultural, 10.3% other open land, and 6.4% 
				not open land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Sources of water views are aggregated 
				into an intermediate node “WaterView” and assigned values for 
				“high,” “low,” and “none” which indicate the likelihood of 
				higher or lower value that could be generated by either a lake 
				or pond view versus a river or stream view (Vissering pers. 
				comm.). WaterView, OpenSpace, and Mountain were combined into a 
				top node, “TheoreticalNaturalBeauty” where each land cover type, 
				with the highest values for large mountains, lakes, and forested 
				open space, the lowest values for non-open space, and no 
				mountains or water views, and intermediate values for other open 
				space and agriculture.&nbsp; These relative values could be 
				adjusted for different parts of the world based on local 
				preferences and hedonic studies indicating relative values of 
				different types.&nbsp; Those high-quality, high-value LULC types 
				will produce the most amenity value allowing me to peg the 
				corners, and interpolate intermediate values to develop the 
				conditional probability (CP) table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>By combining the aesthetic view 
				source value with a source classification layer, we can account 
				for the preference for landscape heterogeneity in a view. People 
				value highly scenic landscapes (those with high theoretical 
				natural beauty as defined in the source model) but also 
				landscapes with a diversity of landform, water characteristics, 
				and vegetation patter (Vissering per. comm., Chhetri and 
				Arrowsmith 2003, USFS 1995). Establishing how much variability 
				is enough may depend on a specific area. Research was lacking on 
				exact numbers in eastern United States, although data from 
				Switzerland shows that in a reforesting landscape people prefer 
				a landscape that was heterogeneous with patches ranging from 
				slightly to mostly reforested (Hunziker and Kienast 1999). <o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Aesthetic view use. <o:p></o:p>
				</span></b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The use model for aesthetic views is 
				based on locations where hikers will be accessing views (i.e. 
				trails, vistas, outcroppings). The enjoyment of this use depends 
				on the height of the viewers’ position, how congested the area 
				is, and the access to the area. The conditional probability 
				table for “ViewerUse” simply states that in order to have value, 
				hikers must be able to access the view (view position, public 
				access, presence of hiking trails) and that there is little 
				congestion of the area. The congestion of an area will depend on 
				both the proximity (in travel cost/time) to population centers 
				and the public use status of the land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A view position in Vermont can be 
				either low (0-1500’ elevation), medium (1500-3000’), or high 
				(3000-5500’). Within the Raven Ridge Preserve, view position can 
				be low (400-500’), medium (500 - 650’), or high (650-800’). 
				Prior probability distributions for view position were based on 
				the percentage of land in Vermont included in each category: low 
				70%, medium 29%, and high 1%. </span><b><span><o:p></o:p></span>
				</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For the state of Vermont, prior 
				probability distributions for public access were based on the 
				amount of current public land in the state (15%) with the 
				remaining land divided between private land (75%) with no access 
				and, to a lesser extent, private lands with public access (10%). 
				Raven Ridge Preserve is owned by The Nature Conservancy with 
				public access. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Travel cost can be low (0-30 
				minutes), medium (30 - 90 minutes), or high (&gt; 90 minutes). 
				Travel cost for the Raven Ridge Preserve was based on the 
				comparison time of travel from Burlington, VT (population 
				center) to fifteen similar TNC properties in Vermont. Based on 
				these fifteen properties, I established prior probability 
				distributions of 20% low travel cost, 20% medium travel cost, 
				and 60% high travel cost. For Raven Ridge Preserve, the travel 
				cost is medium. For other views throughout the state or region, 
				travel cost associated with accessing the site could be 
				calculated using the travel time, based on road class and travel 
				speed, with the proximity to a population center. <o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>PublicAccess and TravelTime were 
				combined into an intermediate node “Congestion” where full 
				public access and low travel time were assumed to produce higher 
				congestion and no public access and high travel time would 
				produce the lowest congestion. The corners were pegged and 
				intermediate values interpolated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hiking difficulty is also a component 
				in view use. Based on the Appalachian Trail, Long Trail, and 
				Green Mountain Club ratings, the difficulty of a hiking trail is 
				based on the slope and the distance of a trail. The difficulty 
				of a hiking trail depends more on the slope. Slope of hiking 
				trails can be steep (greater than 45 degrees), moderate (10-45 
				degrees), or low (up to 10 degrees). Hiking trail distances can 
				be long (greater than 6 miles), medium (2 – 5 miles), or short 
				(less than 2 miles). Prior probability distributions are based 
				off the digital elevation model slope data and a hiking guide 
				book for the state of Vermont (GMC 2003). HikingSlope and 
				HikingDistance were combined into an intermediate node “HikingDifficulty.” 
				A conditional probability table was developed by pegging the 
				corners and interpolating intermediate values using steep slope 
				and long distance as the highest difficulty and low slope and 
				short distance as the lowest difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Finally, all the components of viewer 
				enjoyment (use) are aggregated into an top node “ViewerEnjoyment” 
				and assigned values for “high,” “moderate”, and “low”, with the 
				higher enjoyment values derived from high view position, low 
				congestion, and easy to moderate hiking difficulty and the 
				lowest enjoyment value derived from low view position, high 
				congestion, and strenuous hiking difficulty. Those assumptions 
				allowed me to peg the corners, and interpolate intermediate 
				values to develop the conditional probability (CP) table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Aesthetic view sinks.&nbsp; <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We assumed that either obstructions 
				(e.g., buildings or vegetation) or undesirable visual features 
				(blight associated with development, energy infrastructure or 
				roads) directly obstruct or reduce the quality of views (Gret-Regamey 
				et al. 2008, Bourassa et al. 2004, Benson et al. 1998). Views of 
				lost forest cover, including clearcuts, could also act as a 
				sink, reducing view quality (Palmer 2008, Wundscher et al. 
				2008).&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Prior probability distributions were 
				established using land cover/land use data and other resources. 
				Based on a 1998 Vermont Agency of Natural Resources assessment, 
				approximately 2% of the Vermont landscape was heavily cut or 
				clear cut. This data was used to establish prior probabilities 
				where data layers are missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although not currently included in 
				the models, dust, air pollution, or persistent cloudy or foggy 
				conditions also reduce views, and could act as sinks at variable 
				temporal scales. These could be accounted for as a scenario in 
				the ARIES model dependent on weather and a particular time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
