							<h5 class="style10">Assumptions</h5>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span><b>Sediment regulation 
							source value</b>.&nbsp; Spatial datasets of soil loss and 
							RUSLE/SEDMOD coefficients are available globally as 
							a 0.5 degree<sup>2</sup> raster (Yang et al. 2003) 
							and for the western United States by 8-digit HUC 
							watershed (USEPA 2010).&nbsp; Use of these 
							deterministic models, where appropriate, can reduce 
							the need for using probabilistic models of 
							sedimentation.&nbsp; However, USLE and RUSLE have 
							several well-known limitations (Roose 1996): 1) they 
							apply only to sheet erosion versus linear or mass 
							erosion; 2) they have only been tested in regions 
							with 1-20% slopes and are inappropriate for areas 
							with steeper slopes or young mountains where greater 
							erosion is possible; 3) energy-rainfall 
							relationships have been best tested for the U.S. 
							Great Plains, meaning that locally appropriate 
							rainfall runoff erosivity coefficients must be 
							carefully developed and applied; 4) data are not 
							valid for individual storms but averages; a Modified 
							USLE (Williams 1975) must be used to model sediment 
							loads produced by a single storm; and 5) The 
							equations simplify interactions between factors to 
							attempt to isolate the relative effects of each.&nbsp; 
							Thus USLE/RUSLE are likely most appropriate in level 
							to moderately hilly landscapes similar to the 
							central United States; different models may be more 
							appropriate in other parts of the world.&nbsp;

							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>
							<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Several spatial ecosystem 
							services mapping papers have addressed 
							sedimentation.&nbsp; While Eade and Moran (1996) and 
							Tallis et al. (2010) modeled sedimentation using 
							USLE, Egoh et al. (2008) and Wendland et al. (2010) 
							used other proxy data to model sedimentation.&nbsp; 
							Egoh et al. combined local estimates of soil erosion 
							potential with expert rankings of the ability of 
							vegetation cover to prevent erosion.&nbsp; Based on 
							Quinton et al.’s (1997) work in semiarid Spain, Egoh 
							et al. note that </span>soil erosion is slightly 
							reduced with about 30% vegetation cover and 
							significantly reduced with about 70% vegetation 
							cover.<span>&nbsp; </span>By combining areas of high 
							erosion potential and &lt;30, &gt;30, or &gt;70% vegetation 
							cover, Egoh et al. map the value of vegetation for 
							erosion control.<span>&nbsp; </span>Wendland et al., 
							noting the established link between forest cover and 
							sedimentation for Madagascar (Albietz 2007), map 
							upstream forest cover from population centers, 
							irrigated rice fields, and mangroves – areas that 
							benefit from sediment-free water.</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Sediment regulation 
							sinks</span></b><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We only consider 
							the deposition of sediment in floodplains and 
							reservoirs, as opposed to sediment carried and 
							deposited by overland flow.&nbsp; We define sediment 
							deposition (“ErosionSink”) to be a function of 
							stream/floodplain variables – stream gradient, 
							floodplain vegetation cover, and floodplain width – 
							and artificial structures that narrow the floodplain 
							(levees) or trap sediment (dams) (Figure 15).&nbsp; 
							We assume deposition to be greatest in low-gradient 
							streams with wide floodplains and high levels of 
							vegetation cover, and lowest under the opposite 
							conditions, with intermediate values interpolated.&nbsp; 
							The presence of levees automatically narrows the 
							floodplain from its natural width to “very narrow,” 
							reducing sediment deposition.&nbsp; The presence of 
							reservoirs, which create slack water flow 
							conditions, leads to high deposition levels in all 
							circumstances.&nbsp; Priors for all nodes are 
							qualitative estimates based on GIS data.&nbsp; The 
							erosion sink models for Western Washington and 
							Madagascar are identical, except that prior 
							probabilities for artificial infrastructure are set 
							much lower for less developed settings (e.g., 
							Madagascar) versus hydrologic systems with greater 
							degrees of flow alteration (e.g., Western 
							Washington).&nbsp; We discretized floodplain 
							vegetation percent cover using natural breaks and 
							stream gradient using breakpoints of 0-2% for low 
							gradient streams, 2-5% for moderate gradient 
							streams, and &gt;5% for high gradient streams.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p>
							</span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">
							<o:p></o:p>
							</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We note that 
							process-based models of sediment transport and 
							deposition exist, but may be difficult to apply at 
							the landscape scale using publicly available GIS 
							data. &nbsp;These may also be event-based models, while 
							our ad hoc model simplifies this process by removing 
							the temporal component and considering only 
							landscape-scale metrics.&nbsp; For example, we 
							recognize that even in wide floodplains with high 
							vegetation cover, low stream gradient, and no 
							artificial structures, there will be periods of both 
							high and low sedimentation based on streamflow 
							conditions and sediment loads.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

							<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Sediment regulation 
							use</span></b><span>.&nbsp; While not explicitly 
							incorporating ecosystem service flow models, both 
							Tallis et al. (2010) and Wendland et al. (2010) 
							incorporate the concept of beneficiaries in their 
							sedimentation models.&nbsp; Tallis et al. map the 
							locations of reservoirs where avoided sedimentation 
							is a benefit, and Wendland et al. map human 
							population density (for drinking water), mangroves 
							(for avoided sedimentation of fish habitat), and 
							rice fields (for avoided crop damage).&nbsp; Mapping 
							these beneficiaries can often be done with a single 
							spatial data layer or simple GIS operations rather 
							than Bayesian networks.&nbsp; For instance, we can 
							map: 1) the location of navigation infrastructure 
							(where sedimentation is undesirable), 2) floodplain 
							farmers (where sedimentation may be beneficial or 
							undesirable, by a simple overlay of floodplains and 
							farmland), or 3) erosion-prone farmers (where 
							erosion is undesirable, by intersecting erosion 
							source value and farmland).&nbsp; Hydroelectric dams 
							and public water supply intakes can be mapped, but 
							might also be included in Bayesian networks with 
							their supply areas and population density, with 
							water supplies and hydroelectric generation capacity 
							to serve larger populations being weighted to create 
							a greater degree of use of avoided sedimentation.&nbsp; 
							Similarly, the benefits of avoided sedimentation to 
							fisheries can be mapped by aggregating sites where 
							fishing takes place (lakes, rivers, coast), key 
							habitats for fish (coastal wetlands, salmon spawning 
							grounds for Western Washington, coral reefs, 
							seagrass beds, and mangroves for Madagascar), 
							population density, and public access to fishing.&nbsp; 
							Priors for the more complex fisheries models are 
							based on qualitative estimates from existing spatial 
							data.&nbsp; We set the greatest values in the 
							conditional probability table for fisheries in areas 
							with public access (if relevant), fishing sites 
							and/or habitat features present, and moderate to low 
							population density (assuming that use is simply 
							lower with less human presence and declines at high 
							population density as pollution and habitat 
							destruction accompany high density urbanized 
							environments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

							</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Sediment regulation 
							flow</span></b><span>.&nbsp; Since we are not 
							modeling wind-based erosion for this service, we 
							model sediment flows using a simple hydrologic 
							model.&nbsp; HydroSheds data (Lehner et al. 2008) 
							for flow direction are used to route water across 
							the landscape.&nbsp; While this is admittedly a 
							highly simplistic way to move water and 
							water-related ecosystem service carriers (e.g., 
							drinking water, flood water, suspended sediment, 
							dissolved nutrients), it has the benefit of being 
							applicable at variable spatial scales and at any 
							location on Earth.&nbsp; Future work on ARIES will 
							seek to incorporate appropriate existing hydrologic 
							models to route water and water-related ecosystem 
							service carriers across the landscape at variable 
							spatial scales and under variable environmental 
							conditions (e.g., using appropriate and different 
							models at large vs. small spatial scales and in arid 
							versus humid ecological systems).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
