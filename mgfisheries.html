				<h5>FishBase (Froese and Pauly 2010) lists eight commercially 
				important fish species for Madagascar, in some cases providing 
				descriptions of their habitat, commercial importance, and 
				typical means of harvest.<span>&nbsp; </span>From this list, The 
				Sea Around Us project (Close et al. 2006) provided us with 
				relative abundance maps for four species: southern meagre or cob 
				(<i>Argyrosomus hololepidotus)</i>, sky emperor (<i>Lethrinus 
				mahsena)</i>, slender emperor (<i>Lethrinus variegatus)</i>, and 
				mangrove red snapper (<i>Lutjanus argentimaculatus)</i>. </h5>

				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Subsistence fisheries source value</b>.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>The data available to establish the quantity of fish 
				available for subsistence and other fisheries use (and link this 
				to a flow model) are generally quite sparse.<span>&nbsp; We</span> 
				obtained global relative abundance maps for four species of 
				commercial importance in Madagascar.<span>&nbsp; </span>We also 
				obtained historical catch data for Madagascar from the FAO 
				(2008).<span>&nbsp; </span>These catch data do not explicitly 
				describe subsistence catch, however, and do not contain catch 
				records for any of the four species for which we have relative 
				abundance data.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Despite these limitations, we can use these 
				data, along with a series of assumptions, to estimate the catch 
				for each species (i.e., its supply or source value).<span>&nbsp;
				</span>Historical catch data from The Sea Around Us Project 
				(2010) shows that 71.6% of the total catch for Madagascar from 
				1950-2004 is â€œnon-identified marine pelagic fishes.â€�<span>&nbsp;
				</span>In 2005, Madagascar produced 138,477 tonnes of fish from 
				capture fisheries, of which 77,636 tonnes were for commodity 
				trade and production (FAO 2008).<span>&nbsp; </span>Another 
				72,300 tonnes were taken by traditional fishermen, however, this 
				catch is not necessarily mutually exclusive with the commodity 
				sector.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subtracting the commodity catch from 
				the total catch leaves 60,841 tonnes of fish assumed to go 
				toward local consumption.<span>&nbsp; </span>Assuming 71.6% of 
				the locally consumed fish are â€œnon-identified marine pelagic 
				fishes,â€� these would account for 43,562 tonnes in 2005.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>Assuming that each of the three marine pelagic fishes (<i>L. 
				mahsena</i>, <i>L. variegatus</i>, <i>L. argentimaculatus)</i> 
				for which we have distribution data accounted for 20% of that 
				total, this would give 8,712 tonnes of fish caught for each of 
				these species.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since southern meagre (<i>A. 
				hololepidotus)</i> is a demersal species we do not include it in 
				the totals or in further fisheries mapping, since we have no 
				data on the catch of non-identified marine demersal fish 
				species.<span>&nbsp; </span>We the divide the total catch for 
				each species according to their relative abundance along the 
				Madagascar coast in order to produce a map of subsistence fish 
				production for each species under the above assumptions 
				(Equation 1).</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Mathematically, we can express these 
				assumptions as: </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span>(1)<span>&nbsp; </span>S = a<sub>1</sub>S<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> 
				+ a<sub>3</sub>S<sub>3</sub> + â€¦ + a<sub>n</sub>S<sub>n<span>&nbsp;
				</span></sub></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span>(2)<span>&nbsp; </span>D = a<sub>1</sub>S<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub> 
				+ a<sub>3</sub>S<sub>3</sub> + â€¦ + a<sub>n</sub>S<sub>n </sub>
				<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><sub><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></sub></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Where<span>&nbsp; </span>S = the total 
				source or supply of subsistence fisheries (kg)</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span>D = the total demand for subsistence fisheries (kg)</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span>a = the percentage of the total demand met with species n</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				</span>S = the total mass of species n caught (kg)</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">We thus make a series of admittedly large 
				assumptions based on the very limited available data about the 
				magnitude of supply and demand in Madagascarâ€™s subsistence 
				fishery and the distribution of valuable species.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>However, given better data or expert knowledge of the 
				relative use of different species, we need only to adjust the 
				above coefficients in order to more accurately describe human 
				dependence on Madagascarâ€™s fisheries.<span>&nbsp; </span>Source 
				and use (or supply and demand) for fisheries are both expressed 
				in kg.<span>&nbsp; </span>This allows us to use a common unit in 
				the flow models to move a certain number of kg of fish from 
				areas where they are caught by subsistence fishermen to places 
				where they are consumed by fishermen and their families and 
				communities.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Subsistence fisheries use</b>.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>People are more likely to access fisheries for 
				subsistence purposes when they lack other sources of nutrition 
				(e.g., in poorer regions) and when they have access to a 
				fishery.<span>&nbsp; </span>As determinants of subsistence 
				fisheries use, we used distance to the coast, poverty, and 
				population density as influences of the degree of use (Figure 
				9).<span>&nbsp; </span>We expect the greatest use of subsistence 
				fisheries at lower population densities (i.e., in large cities 
				there is too much crowding, water pollution, and lack of access 
				to fisheries to enable widespread subsistence fishing), greater 
				levels of poverty, and closer proximity to the coast.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>In the conditional probability table for subsistence 
				fisheries use, we assumed that areas that are not proximate to 
				the coast have zero subsistence fisheries use, and that use 
				increases at lower population densities and greater poverty 
				levels.<span>&nbsp; </span>This model does not account for 
				subsistence fisheries from rivers and other inland water bodies, 
				which of course could occur in inland areas.<span>&nbsp; </span>
				We assigned prior probabilities for distance to coast, poverty, 
				and population density based on quantitative analysis of 
				available GIS data for Madagascar.<span>&nbsp; </span>We 
				discretized population density by natural breaks, percent 
				poverty by equal intervals, and distance to the coast based on 
				easily walkable distances (e.g., &lt;1 km, 1-5 km, &gt;5 km).<span>&nbsp;
				</span>We note that fish could also be traded to groups located 
				farther from the coast, with the benefits extending further 
				inland.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, modeling of such trade 
				networks is currently beyond the scope of our models.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The Bayesian network returns likelihood 
				values for subsistence marine fisheries use.<span>&nbsp; </span>
				To convert this to total demand, we note that the average 
				Malagasy consumes 6.8 kg of fish per year (FAO 2008).<span>&nbsp;
				</span>In areas with high subsistence use, we assume 100% of 
				this per capita use to come from the oceanic subsistence 
				fishery.<span>&nbsp; </span>In areas with moderate subsistence 
				use, we assume 67% of this total to come from the oceanic 
				subsistence fishery (4.6 kg/capita), and in areas with low 
				subsistence use we assume 33% of this total to come from the 
				oceanic subsistence fishery (2.3 kg/capita).<span>&nbsp; </span>
				We assume that the remaining unsatisfied demand from moderate 
				and low subsistence users comes from either trade or inland 
				fisheries in rivers and lakes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Similarly to 
				mapping the supply or source of subsistence fisheries, we assume 
				that each of the three valuable species supplies 20% of the fish 
				use for subsistence users (Equation 2).<span>&nbsp; </span>This 
				is an admittedly naÃ¯ve assumption that can be easily corrected 
				by adjusting the model coefficients to better reflect data or 
				expert knowledge of resource use.</p>

				</span>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Subsistence fisheries sinks</b>.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>As an ecosystem good, subsistence fisheries do not have a 
				sink that depletes the flow of an ecosystem good from ecosystems 
				to people.<span>&nbsp; </span>In other words, there are no 
				anthropogenic or biophysical features on the landscape that 
				deplete the quantity of caught fish as they are moved from the 
				point of extraction to the point of consumption.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Subsistence fisheries flow</b>.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>Subsistence fisheries flow models are designed to 
				illustrate the spatial dependence of fisheries users on 
				particular fisheries areas.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subsistence 
				fisheries users are assumed to move from a point of origin 
				(their homes) to an oceanic fishery, harvest fish, and return to 
				their homes, where fish are consumed, via road or path networks.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>Thus the flow models move a given quantity of kg of fish 
				from the ocean to areas of demand.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each 
				coastal ocean pixel has an estimated potential source of fish, 
				as described above in the source model.<span>&nbsp; </span>Each 
				pixel on land has an estimated potential use for oceanic fish, 
				as described above in the use model.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">We assume that the use of oceanic 
				subsistence fisheries is greatest close to the coast, and 
				declines relatively quickly moving inland.<span>&nbsp; </span>We 
				model such distance decay as an exponential curve, with high 
				subsistence use within 1 km of the coast, steep decline at 
				distances of 2-3 km of the coast, and slowly declining 
				subsistence use out to a distance of 5 km of the coast.<span>&nbsp;
				</span>The distance decay function is expressed in the 
				conditional probability table within the subsistence use 
				Bayesian network, where high coastal proximity translates into 
				much higher levels of subsistence fisheries use, holding the 
				other variables in the Bayesian network, poverty and population 
				density, constant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Along with proximity, 
				users must have some form of access (e.g., roads, paths) to get 
				to the coast, river, or lake.</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">The flow models thus move a quantity of 
				fish (in kg) from the coastal ocean toward inland users along a 
				network of paths (the predominant means of transportation in 
				rural Madagascar).<span>&nbsp; </span>As </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Limitations, caveats, and directions for 
				future research</b>. Several large assumptions are built into 
				this model by necessity, largely due to the limited amount of 
				information about fish populations, their locations, and levels 
				of subsistence fisheries use.<span>&nbsp; </span>While the 
				species distribution maps from The Sea Around Us Project (Close 
				et al. 2006) show the relative distribution of each species, 
				they do not show populations or total abundance of each species 
				(clearly an intractable task for marine fisheries biologists).<span>&nbsp;
				</span>We thus make assumptions that the four modeled species...</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">These parameters could be refined based on 
				local data or expert assumptions from those knowledgeable of 
				Madagascarâ€™s subsistence fishing communities. </p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">Modeling species change based on local 
				habitat quality data: should be done in conjunction with locally 
				knowledgable experts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Coupling flow models 
				for current levels of sedimentation and nutrient inputs to 
				nearshore habitats, and these impacts on habitats (Figure X):
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">In the future: add nitrogen runoff (Potter 
				et al. in press)</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal">While we initially model only four species, 
				additional species could easily be added to the model by 
				inputting their distribution maps.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
