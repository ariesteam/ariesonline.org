      <span>A flow model accounts for travel from a person’s home to a 
	  particular location suitable for that recreational activity.&nbsp; In this 
	  way, a recreation flow model can show from where a particular recreation 
	  area draws its users or to which (substitute) areas a specific 
	  recreational user group in the same area gravitates toward.&nbsp; All 
	  recreation models thus contain a transportation network-based flow model 
	  to move people toward recreational areas capable of supporting their 
	  activities of interest.&nbsp; While flows of most other ecosystem services 
	  are defined biophysically (i.e., through movement of water, nutrients, 
	  sediment, or atmospheric gases), biologically (i.e., through migration and 
	  movement of key species), or through trade networks (i.e., for ecosystem 
	  goods) recreational flows are based on human preferences for a particular 
	  activity and perceptions about places capable of providing a setting for 
	  that activity.</span>&nbsp;</h6>

							<h5 class="style10">Assumptions</h5>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Viewsheds. <o:p></o:p>
				</span></b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The use model for aesthetic views is 
				based on locations where hikers will be accessing views (i.e. 
				trails, vistas, outcroppings). The enjoyment of this use depends 
				on the height of the viewers’ position, how congested the area 
				is, and the access to the area. The conditional probability 
				table for “ViewerUse” simply states that in order to have value, 
				hikers must be able to access the view (view position, public 
				access, presence of hiking trails) and that there is little 
				congestion of the area. The congestion of an area will depend on 
				both the proximity (in travel cost/time) to population centers 
				and the public use status of the land. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>A view position in Vermont can be 
				either low (0-1500’ elevation), medium (1500-3000’), or high 
				(3000-5500’). Within the Raven Ridge Preserve, view position can 
				be low (400-500’), medium (500 - 650’), or high (650-800’). 
				Prior probability distributions for view position were based on 
				the percentage of land in Vermont included in each category: low 
				70%, medium 29%, and high 1%. </span><b><span><o:p></o:p></span>
				</b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For the state of Vermont, prior 
				probability distributions for public access were based on the 
				amount of current public land in the state (15%) with the 
				remaining land divided between private land (75%) with no access 
				and, to a lesser extent, private lands with public access (10%). 
				Raven Ridge Preserve is owned by The Nature Conservancy with 
				public access. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Travel cost can be low (0-30 
				minutes), medium (30 - 90 minutes), or high (&gt; 90 minutes). 
				Travel cost for the Raven Ridge Preserve was based on the 
				comparison time of travel from Burlington, VT (population 
				center) to fifteen similar TNC properties in Vermont. Based on 
				these fifteen properties, I established prior probability 
				distributions of 20% low travel cost, 20% medium travel cost, 
				and 60% high travel cost. For Raven Ridge Preserve, the travel 
				cost is medium. For other views throughout the state or region, 
				travel cost associated with accessing the site could be 
				calculated using the travel time, based on road class and travel 
				speed, with the proximity to a population center. <o:p></o:p>
				</span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>PublicAccess and TravelTime were 
				combined into an intermediate node “Congestion” where full 
				public access and low travel time were assumed to produce higher 
				congestion and no public access and high travel time would 
				produce the lowest congestion. The corners were pegged and 
				intermediate values interpolated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Hiking difficulty is also a component 
				in view use. Based on the Appalachian Trail, Long Trail, and 
				Green Mountain Club ratings, the difficulty of a hiking trail is 
				based on the slope and the distance of a trail. The difficulty 
				of a hiking trail depends more on the slope. Slope of hiking 
				trails can be steep (greater than 45 degrees), moderate (10-45 
				degrees), or low (up to 10 degrees). Hiking trail distances can 
				be long (greater than 6 miles), medium (2 – 5 miles), or short 
				(less than 2 miles). Prior probability distributions are based 
				off the digital elevation model slope data and a hiking guide 
				book for the state of Vermont (GMC 2003). HikingSlope and 
				HikingDistance were combined into an intermediate node “HikingDifficulty.” 
				A conditional probability table was developed by pegging the 
				corners and interpolating intermediate values using steep slope 
				and long distance as the highest difficulty and low slope and 
				short distance as the lowest difficulty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Finally, all the components of viewer 
				enjoyment (use) are aggregated into an top node “ViewerEnjoyment” 
				and assigned values for “high,” “moderate”, and “low”, with the 
				higher enjoyment values derived from high view position, low 
				congestion, and easy to moderate hiking difficulty and the 
				lowest enjoyment value derived from low view position, high 
				congestion, and strenuous hiking difficulty. Those assumptions 
				allowed me to peg the corners, and interpolate intermediate 
				values to develop the conditional probability (CP) table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Aesthetic view sinks.&nbsp; <o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>We assumed that either obstructions 
				(e.g., buildings or vegetation) or undesirable visual features 
				(blight associated with development, energy infrastructure or 
				roads) directly obstruct or reduce the quality of views (Gret-Regamey 
				et al. 2008, Bourassa et al. 2004, Benson et al. 1998). Views of 
				lost forest cover, including clearcuts, could also act as a 
				sink, reducing view quality (Palmer 2008, Wundscher et al. 
				2008).&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Prior probability distributions were 
				established using land cover/land use data and other resources. 
				Based on a 1998 Vermont Agency of Natural Resources assessment, 
				approximately 2% of the Vermont landscape was heavily cut or 
				clear cut. This data was used to establish prior probabilities 
				where data layers are missing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
				<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Although not currently included in 
				the models, dust, air pollution, or persistent cloudy or foggy 
				conditions also reduce views, and could act as sinks at variable 
				temporal scales. These could be accounted for as a scenario in 
				the ARIES model dependent on weather and a particular time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

							<p class="MsoNormal"><b>B<span>irding and hunting 
							value.&nbsp; </span></b></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Birding and hunting are 
							two biodiversity-based recreation ecosystem services 
							provided by the Southeast Arizona’s San Pedro River.&nbsp; 
							The San Pedro is internationally known as a birding 
							area, and draws visitors from across the United 
							States and world.&nbsp; As a key water source in an 
							arid region, the San Pedro is also habitat for 
							several valued game species, including white-tailed 
							and mule deer, javelina, white-winged and mourning 
							dove, and Mearns’, Gambel’s, and scaled quail.&nbsp; 
							Potentially valuable birding areas can be identified 
							based on spatial data for bird species richness.&nbsp; 
							Hunting potential can be identified based on habitat 
							quality maps for the above-listed game species.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">
							<o:p></o:p>
							</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Initial data to map 
							recreational use can be based on a population or 
							housing density map.&nbsp; For some activities, it 
							may be possible to estimate the percentage of the 
							population taking part in that recreational activity 
							(i.e., the number of licensed hunters in a state 
							relative to its total population).&nbsp; 
							Representing users as a uniform percentage of the 
							population engaging in a particular activity makes 
							the admittedly naïve assumption that the same 
							percentage of recreational users across all 
							communities engage in a particular activity.&nbsp; A 
							more realistic model would account for the fact that 
							different types of communities are likely to prefer 
							different recreational activities, and in some cases 
							choose their location of residence to provide 
							proximity to a valued recreational amenity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Recreation sinks</span></b><span>.</span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Sinks will be present for 
							some, but not all types of recreation.&nbsp; For 
							viewsheds, the sink model identifies areas of visual 
							blight that reduce view quality, similar to the 
							aesthetic viewsheds model.&nbsp; For most types of 
							recreation where the source value can be assessed <i>
							in situ</i>, no sink model is necessary.&nbsp; This 
							is the case for the birding and hunting models for 
							the San Pedro River.&nbsp; However, a new 
							habitat-based flow model could eventually be 
							developed or an existing one incorporated to account 
							for spatial dependencies in bird or game habitat.&nbsp; 
							Such habitat models are not currently included in 
							the modeling framework.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal">
							<o:p></o:p>
							</p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><b><span>Recreation flow</span></b><span>.
							</span></p>
							<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Recreational flow models 
							should ideally incorporate several factors that 
							define how people choose among and travel to 
							recreational sites.&nbsp; Ideally this would 
							incorporate the distance that people are willing to 
							travel in order to reach a particular recreational 
							site.&nbsp; If data or studies are available, zip 
							code based travel cost or recreational preference 
							surveys can show how far people travel to a 
							particular site.&nbsp; Otherwise an expert-informed 
							distance decay function for a particular activity 
							could be constructed.&nbsp; The distance potential 
							recreational users are willing to travel to a given 
							site differs based on the quality of the site and 
							its substitutes, as well as the nature of the 
							activity.&nbsp; For instance, on the San Pedro, 
							birders visit the site from around the nation and 
							world.&nbsp; Hunters and other recreational users 
							(e.g., hikers, mountain bikers, equestrians, viewers 
							of historical sites) are less likely to travel great 
							distances (i.e., these visitors are more likely to 
							come from “local” areas such as the San Pedro Valley 
							itself or from Tucson, with Phoenix being considered 
							a long-distance trip).&nbsp; The flow model uses a 
							data layer for road locations and speed limits to 
							estimate the time needed to move people from their 
							residences to recreational sites.&nbsp; The flow 
							model should also define how and why people choose 
							to visit one site over another – based on factors 
							such as distance, the site’s ecological quality, the 
							quality of recreational facilities, and congestion.&nbsp; 
							While such data may be available for some 
							recreational sites, in many cases it will need to be 
							informed by expert opinion, anecdotal observations 
							by park managers, or data from the recreation 
							literature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
