University of Vermont's Gund Institute of Ecological Economics. Several
partners worked together to bring the ARIES concept to life and apply it to
specific regions with and specific planning concerns.</h1>

        <p class="style8" style="width: 609px;"><b>Ferdinando Villa, Principal 
		Investigator. </b> Ferdinando holds a Ph.D. in theoretical Ecology
        and had a long parallel career as a scientific software designer and
        engineer. After working in many fields of Ecology, from theoretical
        Island Biogeography to spatially-explicit Decision Analysis, he joined
        the Gund Institute for Ecological Economics at the University of
        Vermont. He has since expanded the focus of his research to the
        interface of policy, ecology and economics, concentrating on artificial
        intelligence approaches to assist environmental decision making and
        natural system assessment and valuation. Dr. Villa currently leads the
        ARIES project (Artificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services which is
        producing a next-generation web application meant to make environmental
        decisions easier and more effective. Along with ARIES, Dr. Villa
        collaborates with many other projects including the Long Term Ecosystem
        Research project and the SEAMLESS (System for Environmental and
        Agricultural Modeling; Linking European Science and Society project,
        financed by the EU. His research on high-performance computer
        simulation and mathematical modeling applied to community and ecosystem
        ecology earned him collaborations with UNESCO, the European Union, the
        Italian Ministry of the Environment and several international
        organizations such as the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission
        (SOPAC) in Fiji. He has collaborated with international institutions
        and governments on environmental assessment methods, and continues to
        do research in basic ecology, protected areas planning, and related
        fields. He is the author or coauthor of 110+ scientific publications
        and a number of major open source software packages. He has been the
        recipient of several million USD in grants from both the US National
        Science Foundation and the European Union, to develop tools for
        decision makers that integrate the best science with automated,
        AI-assisted decision tools.� Ferdinando currently works at the Basque
        Center for Climate Change and can be reached at <a

        Ecological Economist/Senior Director for the Science and Knowledge at
        Conservation International (CI). Dr. Portela's research focus primarily
        on improving the understanding of the linkages between biodiversity
        conservation, and the provision of ecosystem services (ES). She leads a
        team of researchers working on a variety of biophysical and economics
        modeling techniques to estimate provision, benefits and values of
        ecosystem services at multiple scales, working across several CI
        divisions, field offices and other research partners on terrestrial and
        marine biomes. She also works on the development of decision-supporting
        tools (DST) designed to enhance mapping and valuation of ecosystem
        services and to facilitate trade-off analysis of alternative scenarios
        of development, making every effort to make her scientific work on
        ecosystem service policy-relevant. Elements of Dr. Portela's work
        include: spatial assessment and valuation of ES provision; supporting
        development of ARIES; supporting development of the scientific
        framework, providing policy recommendations, and compiling ecosystem
        services values for TEEB - The Economics of Ecosystem and Biodiversity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Dr. Portela has extensive experience with natural resources management
        in the Brazilian southern Amazon, where she worked for the Mato Grosso
        State Environmental Agency (FEMA). She has a Master's degree from the
        University of Florida, Gainesville and a Ph.D. from the University of
        Maryland, College Park, where she worked on modeling techniques to
        improve the understanding of complex ecosystems and their relevance to
        humans. Her academic research focused on the provision of ecosystem
        goods and services in the Amazon forest and their contribution to human
        economy and well-being. Prior to joining CI, Dr. Portela worked for the
        World Bank Institute to advance understanding of how market mechanisms
        can be used to conserve biodiversity and support the provision of ES
        while generating livelihood income. Rosimeiry can be reached at<span>
