					<img alt="Chehalis River Basin" height="398" src="../img/chehalis.jpg" width="292" class="style17" style="float: left">ARIES is built on basic science and our understanding of how 
				natural systems work. The better the data on hydrology, 
				topography, soils, and other determining factors are, the better 
				ARIES can perform. Ecosystem services (ES), such as flood 
				protection are concerned with the way natural systems affect 
				people. With this in mind, ARIES produces four types of models, 
				based on GIS and other data: 1) Beneficiary models; 2) 
				Provisioning models; 3) Sink models and 4) Critical vector 
				models (not yet fully developed). </p>
				<p style="margin-top:32px;text-align:justify;margin-bottom:24px; width: 604px;" class="style14">
				Initial ARIES mapping and results for the Chehalis River Basin, 
				excluded a hydrological model, but utilized geographic 
				information systems data specific to the Chehalis River Basin. 
				Mapping and understanding the beneficiaries, provisioning and 
				damagers of flood also sets in place the basis for a funding 
				mechanism that can be developed for the Flood Authority. </p>

				<p style="height: 22px;">In the case of the Chehalis River Basin 
				and flood protection, the basic GIS data was first gathered, 
				then through complex mathematical procedures brought into 
				compatibility (because rainfall data, slope, vegetation cover 
				and other data are often assembled on different scales). Next, 
				conceptual models for each of the beneficiary, provisioning and 
				sink systems were constructed. These models are currently based 
				on many assumptions. To fully develop this model would require 
				close collaboration with the Flood Authority, Army Corps of 
				Engineers, utilizing the best available data, LIDAR and 
				hydrologic models. The final maps produced do represent real 
				results using real data from the Chehalis River Basin for 
				examining flood protection. The beneficiary maps are more 
				accurate than the final flood protection maps because the 
				hydrology not fully included (or understood), and these models 
				require further refining. The provisioning maps in particular 
				should be seen as a very preliminary and incomplete rendition of 
				what could be produced with further work.</p>

                    <p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 609px">Providing a 
					working example of how ARIES can differentiate between 
					project proposals was outside the scope of this study. The 
					ARIES team is currently developing scenario analysis with 
					actual data from the Chehalis River Basin. A discussion of 
					this planned scenario generation tool follows.<br></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 609px">One strength of 
					the ARIES technology to allow good scenario generation is 
					the simultaneous mapping of benefits resulting from 
					ecosystem services, the beneficiaries that receive them, and 
					the flows of water, matter, energy or information that 
					connect benefits or damages to beneficiaries. Because of the 
					mapping of flows, ARIES will be capable of estimating not 
					only the potential provision of ecosystem services, such as 
					flood protection, but also levels of value or damage 
					provided to specific beneficiary groups. <br></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 609px">A work session in 
					the Chehalis River Basin, running an ARIES flood scenario 
					analysis would proceed as follows:<br></p>
					<p class="style12" style="width: 609px">1. An operator would 
					select the area of interest, e.g. the upper Chehalis 
					watershed and initiate a baseline flow analysis. This would 
					source the integrated database of GIS, levee, dam, 
					floodplain and other data to configure and produce 
					probabilistic models of flood source, flood protection, and 
					beneficiary assessment data for use in modeling. This serves 
					as a basis to compute flood protection scenarios.<br><br>2. 
					The baseline scenario is defined by the in terms of 
					precipitation events, level of ground water saturation and 
					other inputs, and in terms of actions or policies to be 
					simulated on the landscape (e.g. land use changes, 
					construction or removal of levees, etc.). After the baseline 
					and future scenarios have been defined, the model is run. 
					Parameters can include a default hydrological model 
					developed within ARIES, or, eventually, any desired 
					hydrological model, which can be “bolted” onto ARIES. Thus, 
					ARIES will be able to use different hydrological models for 
					scenarios under different model applications. <br><br>3. The 
					product of flow analysis is a set of maps that detail the 
					quantity, speed and elevation along which floodwater moves 
					across the landscape and either reaches structures and 
					beneficiaries, or cannot (beneficiaries may have moved out 
					of the way) or is intercepted and diverted. The model could 
					compare scenarios with changes in land use patterns, 
					elevated structures, increased forest cover, greater 
					permeability to groundwater, dams, levees, roads, bridges, 
					filling of the riverbed with sediment and other potential 
					scenarios. <br><br>4. Because ARIES models individual 
					beneficiaries it can compute the precise areas of flood 
					protection provisioning or source flood waters that affect 
					them. In this way, the fine-grained effects of policy or 
					global changes can be studied with scenarios, both overall 
					and on a household-to-household basis. <br><br>5. Because 
					ARIES computes other ecosystem services besides flood 
					protection (currently carbondioxide mitigation, aesthetic 
					beauty, proximity to open space, and soon soil erosion, 
					drinking water and others), the overall value of each 
					scenario can also be compared at a glance showing the 
					influence on other ecosystem services and their 
					beneficiaries. <br><br>6. ARIES also computes not only the 
					provision of each ES, but also the fraction of benefits that 
					actually reach beneficiaries (and the explicit spatial 
					routes of this provision), the efficiency of provision (the 
					ratio of the potential benefit that is actually used) can be 
					calculated under each scenario. This can then be compared to 
					other flood protection investments, or any combinations of 
					flood protection investments to show how much benefit was 
					received by which beneficiaries across the landscape and how 
					efficient or co-dependent each investment was in providing 
					these benefits. These benefits could be measured as fewer 
					residences flooded, less economic damage, lowered flood 
					water elevations, fewer people and economic assets in the 
					floodplain and in danger of flooding.<br><br>7. In addition, 
					ARIES provides measures of uncertainty. Though two forest 
					areas or structures may be identified as providing flood 
					protection, however, the levels of certainty provisioning 
					may be different. Uncertainty can be shown as data or 
					mapped.</p>
					<p class="style12" style="width: 609px">&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">A scenario generator will change the 
					model parameters based on user inputs for different actions 
					in subwatersheds such as a levee, dam, elevated structures, 
					land use changes or increased retention from wetland 
					restoration or other flood protection actions. These action 
					scenarios can be combined with different rainfall and flood 
					source scenarios to provide a variety of flood scenario 
					results. With this, the Flood Authority or other users can 
					test the robustness of one flood action with different 
					rainfall, temperature, snow, groundwater saturation states.<span>&nbsp;
