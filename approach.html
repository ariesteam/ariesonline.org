		      		<h5 class="style10">A modeling platform</h5>
	    	  		<p style="margin-bottom:24px">ARIES is a modeling platform 
					rather than a single model or collection of models. ARIES is 
					capable of incorporating existing ecological process models 
					where appropriate, and turns to ad hoc models where existing 
					process models do not exist or are inadequate for local 
					contexts</p>
                    
		      		<h5 class="style10">Ad hoc models</h5>
	    	  		<p style="margin-bottom:24px">ARIES ad hoc models are 
					probabilistic, Bayesian models, which offer the advantages 
					of explicitly conveying uncertainty and being capable of 
					operating in data-scarce conditions. Rather than specifying 
					the equations that define the relationships between model 
					variables, as is done in deterministic modeling, ARIES is 
					capable of using the data to derive the relationships 
					between variables, learning these relationships, and 
					applying results to data-scarce conditions.</p>
                    
		      		<h5 class="style10">Spatial dynamics</h5>
	    	  		<p style="margin-bottom:24px">Many researchers have noted 
					that provision and use of ecosystem services take place at 
					different temporal and spatial scales.&nbsp; Yet aside from 
					hydrologic ecosystem service models, researchers have too 
					often ignored the fact that the location of ecosystems, 
					their human beneficiaries, and the biophysical nature of 
					ecosystem service flows affect how much of a service is 
					actually used by people. ARIES explicitly accounts for the 
					spatial dynamics of ecosystem services. </p>
					<h5 class="style10">Accessability</h5>
	    	  		<p style="margin-bottom:24px">ARIES is accessible from any 
					internet browser, with all functions handled remotely and 
					returned to the user via a web interface. Data and model 
					storage, data transformations, model runs, and reporting of 
					results take place behind the scenes without the need to 
					purchase and gain proficiency using commercial GIS or 
					modeling software.</p>
					<h5 class="style10">Local models</h5>
	    	  		<p style="margin-bottom:24px"><span>ARIES includes models 
					tailored to reflect local ecological conditions relevant to 
					ecosystem service provision and socioeconomic 
					characteristics that influence use of and demand for 
					ecosystem services.&nbsp; Local case studies typically include 
					data at finer spatial resolution or that is more descriptive 
					of local conditions.&nbsp; Users interested in developing new 
					case studies will eventually be able to edit the models and 
					submit local GIS data for their case study directly to the 
					system.&nbsp; Until these features are available, users 
					interested in developing local case studies should
					<a href="mailto:ecoinformatics@uvm.edu">contact the ARIES 
					development team</a> to discuss potential partnership or 
					training opportunities in developing new case studies.</span>&nbsp;</p>
					<h5 class="style10">Global model</h5>
	    	  		<p style="margin-bottom:24px"><span>ARIES will eventually 
					include a generalized global model to describe the 
					provision, use, and spatial dynamics of each ecosystem 
					service along with corresponding pre-loaded global datasets 
					(typically ranging from 1 degree<sup>2</sup> to 1 km<sup>2</sup> 
					in spatial resolution).&nbsp;</span></p>

			&nbsp;With growing interest in using ecosystem services for decision 
			making, demand has grown for systematic methods and tools to 
			quantify ecosystem service values. ARIES maps the potential 
			provision of ecosystem services (sources), their users (use), and 
			biophysical features that can deplete service flows (sinks) using 
			ecological process models or Bayesian models. ARIES then uses a 
			series of agent-based flow algorithms to map actual service flow

                		<p class="MsoNormal" style="width: 600px">Bayesian 
						statistical approaches have been used to address a 
						variety<b> </b>of issues in environmental valuation and 
						value transfer (Brundson and Willis 2002), including 
						determination of which independent variables to include 
						in regression models (Moeltner and Rosenberger 2007, 
						Leon-Gonzalez and Scarpa 2008), accounting for the “n 
						vs. k” problem in function transfer, and in handling the 
						effects of methodological independent variables when 
						using a transfer function (Moeltner et al. 2007, 
						Moeltner and Woodward 2009).<span>&nbsp; </span>Bayesian 
						methods are a general approach to statistical problems 
						in meta analysis and function transfer rather than a 
						one-size-fits-all solution to the problems of ecosystem 
						service valuation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Despite the use of 
						Bayesian approaches to meta analysis and function 
						transfer, the ARIES project is the first to use Bayesian 
						models to map ecosystem services provision, use, and 
						spatial dynamics.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">Basic principles of Bayesian models 
						in ecology are described well by McCann et al. (2006), 
						part of a special issue of the Canadian Journal of 
						Forest Research dealing with Bayesian modeling in 
						ecology.<span>&nbsp; </span>Marcot et al. (2006) provide 
						a number of basic principles for Bayesian modeling that 
						we have followed in our work regarding model 
						construction, development of prior and conditional 
						probabilities, and testing and review of the models.<span>&nbsp;
						</span>Per Marcot et al.’s recommendations on keeping 
						conditional probability tables tractable and 
						transparent, we generally use no more than 3-5 discrete 
						states for each variable (often classified as 
						“high-moderate-low” or “very high-high-moderate-low-very 
						low”), make each variable a function of no more than 3-5 
						other variables, and use intermediate variables where 
						appropriate.<span>&nbsp; </span>We direct readers with 
						further interest in Bayesian networks and stronger 
						backgrounds in probability theory to Pearl (1988).</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">We note that some readers who are 
						unfamiliar with Bayesian approaches may feel 
						uncomfortable with the perceived subjectivity of 
						assigning prior and conditional probabilities in our 
						models.<span>&nbsp; </span>We feel that Brundson and 
						Willis (2002) address this point quite well: </p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<p class="style11">“Some would argue that 
							incorporating beliefs about models other than those 
							implied by empirical measurement is a subjective, or 
							unscientific, approach.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
							response, it could be stated that, certainly, 
							Bayesianism has the potential for this problem to 
							arise, and so one must have a strict ‘code of 
							conduct’ for prior distribution specification.<span>&nbsp;
							</span>For example, making use of the outcomes off 
							previous studies to provide prior beliefs is a 
							reasonable scientific standpoint.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it could be argued that it is unscientific 
							to ignore these prior results!<span>&nbsp; </span>Another way of avoiding subjectivity is to use 
							non-informative priors in cases where prior 
							information is unavailable or unobserved.<span>&nbsp;
							</span>Of course, one could argue that even a 
							non-informative prior gives us <i>some</i> form of 
							information about the distribution of an unknown 
							parameter: after all, a specific distribution is 
							being supplied rather than the information that <i>any</i> distribution might apply.<span>&nbsp; 
						</span>However, in many cases non-informative priors do 
							make reasonable models for a state of no subjective 
							knowledge.<span>&nbsp; </span>In several ‘text-book’ 
							examples of Bayesian analysis, for example multiple 
							linear regression analysis assuming normal error 
							terms, the adoption of non-informative priors 
							results in tests algebraically identical to 
							classical inferential procedures.<span>&nbsp; </span>In most cases, analysts are reasonably satisfied 
							with regarding such classical approaches as 
							‘objective’.”</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">As described for each model, we 
						incorporate model elements from the literature and 
						conversations with local experts on each ecosystem 
						service, facilitated by our case study partners – 
						Conservation International in Madagascar, CI and INECOL 
						in Veracruz, Mexico, Earth Economics in Western 
						Washington, and the U.N. Environmental Program-World 
						Conservation Monitoring Center (UNEP-WCMC) for marine 
						ecosystem services.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">Users should note that ad hoc 
						Bayesian models are not always appropriate or necessary 
						in the ARIES system – where well-accepted, peer-reviewed 
						ecological process models can provide input data or 
						values for the source, sink, or use of an ecosystem 
						service, these models can be incorporated instead of 
						probabilistic models.<span>&nbsp; </span>The ARIES 
						system is then instructed as to which cases to use the 
						probabilistic versus deterministic model (e.g., in a 
						particular part of the world or at a particular spatial 
						scale).<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, in some cases 
						(particularly for the beneficiary or use models), a 
						single spatial data layer or a simple GIS operation on 
						two or more layers may suffice to map beneficiaries, 
						rather than requiring a Bayesian network.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<h4 class="style10">Next steps<o:p></o:p></h4>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p>Like all ecological 
						models, ARIES remains a work in progress as we continue 
						to add the latest ecological knowledge and spatial 
						datasets, incorporate existing process-based models 
						where these can better inform ecosystem services 
						modeling, build new probabilistic models for additional 
						ecosystem services, and customize existing probabilistic 
						models to provide useful estimates for new case study 
						regions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Further testing of these 
						models and review with local experts and decision makers 
						for the case studies is a critical next step for the 
						ARIES system in order to move it from a position of 
						demonstrating the spatial dynamics of ecosystem services 
						to being able to quantitatively inform conservation, 
						restoration, land use, development, and resource 
						extraction choices.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">The economic valuation system in 
						ARIES is currently limited in scope.<span>&nbsp; </span>
						Services are expressed in either biophysical units 
						(i.e., for carbon, sediment, or flood water) or relative 
						units (e.g., for view quality or recreational value).<span>&nbsp;
						</span>Longer-range plans include integration of ARIES 
						with the Ecosystem Services Database (ESD, Villa et al. 
						2002).<span>&nbsp; </span>This will enable users to view 
						primary economic valuation studies from their region of 
						interest.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since ARIES is capable of 
						mapping ecosystem service flows – the connection between 
						ecosystems and their human beneficiaries, spatial 
						determinants of supply and demand, and in handing data 
						probabilistically, future additions to the system can 
						enable more sophisticated forms of value transfer that 
						incorporate benefit flows and Bayesian approaches.<span>&nbsp;
						</span>In the interim, an economic valuation system in 
						ARIES links land use-land cover types to per-area 
						economic value derived from studies like Costanza et al. 
						(1997).<span>&nbsp; </span>The drawbacks of this 
						approach are quite well known, and users are advised to 
						interpret such results with a full understanding of 
						their limitations.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
						<p class="MsoNormal">ARIES is an open-source project 
						that strives for transparency in its use of data and 
						models.<span>&nbsp; </span>We encourage all ARIES users 
						to submit suggestions, edits, and additions to our 
						library of models and spatial data, and to this modeling 
						guide, as we continue working to improve the system.<span>&nbsp;
						</span>Thank you for your interest as we work to build a 
						system for improved environmental management built on 
						the principles of environmental sustainability, socially 
						just access to resources, and a more efficient 
						allocation between market and non-market goods and 
						services.</p>
